### Features
- [x] Made only with pure Javascript, without using libraries like jquery, lodash, etc.<br>
- [x] Layout mobile and desktop<br>
- [x] When entering the game, the user is asked how many cards he wants to play<br>
- [x] An even number between 4 and 14 cards must be chosen to start the game<br>
- [x] Clicking on a card turns it over with a 3D animation effect<br>
- [x] If it is the first card turned over, the game awaits the user's second choice. If it is the second card, it is checked whether the cards are a pair.<br>
- [x] If the user hits the pair, the cards remain face up. In case of an error, the cards return face down after 1 second.<br>
- [x] When the user finishes turning all cards correctly, an alert is displayed with the message "You won in X seconds!".<br>
- [x] At the top right of the screen, there is a timer counting how many seconds have passed since the game started.<br>
- [x] At the end of the game, the user is asked with a prompt if he would like to restart the game. If you answer yes, the game is restarted asking for the number of cards.<br>
